TracDataExtraction
==================

Scripts (shell and perl) that will:
1. download data from trac
2. analyse it
3. generate clean csv ready for data import 
4. Generate e-mails to keep track of changes

Short term improvements:
- sort direction option

Plausible long term improvements:
Automatic generation of diagrams and reports, instead of manually importing the data and generating the report.
